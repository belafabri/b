## **Testing Methodology** 

My testing process was here and there, I discussed it with my manager and he was open to my expiration as long as I provided an ethical practice. I don't know how many hours but it was far over 15-hour+ hours and I took the initiative to pay for the subscription myself since I felt like I was learning and didn't want my manager to pay for it in my learning stages. While the actual act of building and time spent was for class, its end purpose was for work so he wanted to pay me. Using it as a collaborative partner to build an application enhanced my desires to succeed, I had to just communicate the needs, I didn't need any coding experience. My methodology was not just to test the model for class, it was to prepare something applicable that I could leave the company with when I graduate and move to LA. I know that it took me a while to understand the breakdown of the company so I want to make it streamline for the next hire. The iterative development process will still be continued as the current status of the app is not effective or trained enough. Throughout the weeks, my process included:

* **Week 2-3 (Initial Exploration):** I started with a broad, complex prompt: to build an advanced QuickBooks and goal-tracking app. In hopes to bring our costs down. This was a huge task and a lot of responsibility if this transition worked.   
* **Week 4-5 (Deep Testing & Pivoting):** I realized the initial prompt was not the pain point, was too hard to integrate, and ethically challenging. So, I rethought my whole project and prompt. I pivoted to focus on the company’s critical challenge (the reason I was hired) and my desire to streamline the overwhelming amount of work that I had to do. I wanted to build a custom, secure document management system for the small company to solve their chaotic file management which was initially a filing cabinet and then, Google Drive. Despite my efforts to use Google Drive, I knew there was room for improvement and a better structure to the folders. Plus, I wanted to ensure that when I searched up a document, AI could navigate to anywhere despite if it was not the title of the file.  The storage space remaining after 1 year of usage was a dictator if this was needed. I knew that if we kept years of files, eventually we would have to make this transition.   
* **Week 6-7 (Failure Analysis):** I stress tested the AI's ability to write a professional React application. This led to multiple, repeated failures and ultimately began eating my tokens away but simply asking it to fix the problem. At times, I realize that the button to “fix” was not successful so I began searching for suggestions of where the error in the code could have been. I wasn't very good at that so eventually I ran out.   
* **Week 8-10 (Synthesis & Final Product):** I refined the app by adding colors and details of the company. I even tried to give the AI our company website and requested it to match the format. The purpose was to integrate an application that seemed personable to the orientation of the company’s perception but also structure of operation.

## **Career-Relevant Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Secure Document Vault** 

**Context:** The company's 10GB+ of files were disorganized in Google Drive. We needed a single, secure, and searchable source for our documents that ensured my manager felt safe. He is unsure of all kinds of technology platforms, even the initial transformation of GD scared him. 

**Process:** I used Taskade’s connect to drive feature to build a reactive application to the documents that were received. The app's document vault page is a UI that connects to a Taskade Project (workspace), which functions as the secure backend database. The initial stages required the document files transferred. 

**Output:** It only retrieved 30 days of files, not the entire drive. However the synchronized files within those days were fully viewable and searchable based on content. It continued to do so by updating daily with the incoming documents from Google Drive. It appeared in a similar style as Google Drive, not folders (yet). This is the core "Documents" tab seen in my video walkthrough.   
**Time Saved:** In a work week, I would estimate 2-3 hours per week of manual file-searching and version-checking. There are some documents (on GD) that I am unable to see the entire title so I have to click it, now I just search. 

**Quality Assessment:** Has many improvements coming. The output is a professional, secure tool that, with a few additions, directly solves the company's primary pain point. I think quality requires a few more months of building (need more tokens).

### **Use Case 2: Automated Expiration & Renewal Tracking**

**Context:** The company was failing to track critical expiration dates for insurance policies and business licenses. There was no streamline to remembering when they were necessary to renew, just memorization.  Manually checking was error-prone and the recorded date often got lost on a post-it. Overall, it has been creating significant legal and financial risk.

**Process:** I built an analyze and scanning automation with the AI from the built-in integration of the Drive. Documents were to be categorized based on these expiration dates and placed in the “Reminders” field as well as marked by its priority. Highlighting items that needed attention.

**Output:** It scans only the last 30 days and new documents that are in our drive and searches for important renewals. Otherwise, the dashboard automatically transfers flags high-risk, critical documents to the platform,  preventing lapses in prospect jobs, licenses, and any type of equipment renewal. This is the "Reminders" tab in the final app.

**Time Saved:** I estimate around 4-5 hours per month of manual auditing, searching for emails in between subscriptions and ads is saved. A huge amount of risk reduction but requires initial manual conversion from downloaded files. Time for my manager would be 3 hours saved after all the training (every file in the drive) is given to the AI. 

**Quality Assessment:** Extremely high, it's hard to differentiate what emails are for me to read and which are for my manager. This automation moves the company from a reactive to a proactive operational model with straightforward tasks for each manager.

### **Use Case 3: Internal & External Communication \- Emails** 

**Context:** Critical client emails that can include potential jobs, legal notices, urgent changes, beneficial business modifications, were being missed in a busy/shared inbox.

**Process:** I created a Taskade automation that monitors a connected Gmail account by manual flags. When a user "red flags" (stars) on an email, the automation instantly copies its content (sender, subject, link) into a "Flagged Emails" section. While partially manual, it differentiates the items, leaving an easier access for the CEO. 

**Output:** A high-priority inbox, dedicated for the CEO, showing only critical messages requiring action. While some emails were flagged and shown, I had a hard time syncing it to perform the right task. Therefore it did not have a “completed” option or a “draft response” option, which minimized its proficiency. 

- *Current Run ID for screen recording purposes:* *01KB85W8QV64BNRBJNS4DXWAJ8* 

**Time Saved:** I estimate 1 hour per day of manual email triage and double handling stress. This now can allow managers to save 15 minutes of focused review. After subscription renewal, the AI can create automations for email responses. 

**Quality Assessment:** Challenged because of niche arrangement of the operations. While it creates a reliable system for managing high-priority communications, it will not be able to achieve full automation simply because of our standards.

## **Failures & Limitations**

### **Failure 1: The "Code Error \-\> Token Eater" Concept** 

* **What I Tried**: I asked it to design the complex, multi-page application by saying “Focusing on the entire app style. I like the way the website, coastalex.com looks and I think we should integrate that style and simplicity into the app. Would you be able to completely transform the app to look similar to that website but ensure that you keep all of the structure in the side bar. I want to be able to use the app so eliminate all AI instructions on every page and make it look like an app (should adapt to fit on the mobile screen well and then adapt to the online portal)”  
* **Why It Failed**: The AI was overwhelmed and resulted in a biased approach to my prompting. I took no organized approach, I just found things I wanted to change as I reviewed the application. When I spontaneously prompted a design modification of integrating our company website, it may have misunderstood the section I was referring to and tried to retrieve code to input into the application. It repeatedly generated subtle syntax errors in the entire application (a single missing } or a \> operator in the JSX code). This burnt up time and tokens, yet resulted in a blank white screen or Loading screen. The AI was not efficient at debugging its own code, which resulted in a loop of "It's broken" \-\> "try this fix" \-\> "still broken." 

* **Screenshots:**

<img width="540" height="720" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-29 at 10 41 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/269a060b-30b0-484f-8a36-059df07d6aba" />
<img width="438" height="720" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-29 at 10 41 30 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44c07631-754d-46b0-9a5a-4c1e4207cd15" />
<img width="786" height="547" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-29 at 10 41 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7965c2fb-6af8-46f5-814a-ce593282d862" />

* **Lesson Learned:** Lack of context and structured prompting results in unintentional but necessary bias. The AI develops the code quickly and while it may sound like it knows which section I am referring to, I have to take a systematic approach. I can't always trust AI-generated code and fixes even if it tells me “Perfect”, there must be human verification. 

### **Failure 2: The Reminding Data Hallucination**

**What I Tried:** Asking the AI to organize our files and with excitement of its abilities, asked it to also create a reminder for our policies and important information based on these files. The exact request: “Now, I would like to categorize all documents in their files based on where they are in the drive right now, do you have the ability to put them in their appropriate folders and label them for easy access? Keep in mind that some folders in our drive are old licenses and we have put in new ones (bc you are referring to old files, your reminder section is not correct) ensure that you see the documents and the updated policies that are on the drive to edit your reminders to be useful.”  
**Why It Failed:** As I explained in my written analysis, the AI looked at the database, found an old, expired license (which was stored for archival records), and created an alert: "Business license is 527 days expired\!" This was false and caused panic which would be a normal reaction in the real world. The AI lacked the human context or data to differentiate between a "current, active" license and an "archived" one. Since it did not get all of the Drive files and only the last 30 days.   
**Screenshots:** 
<img width="503" height="441" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-29 at 10 42 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8744c6e0-ffe2-4990-b19a-e69c6ceb2c6d" />

* **Lesson Learned:** AI automation is only as good as its training. It cannot handle ambiguity or implicit human context. This failure proved that critical automations must have a human  to verify the results. I had to 1.advise this critical  information and 2\. Provide all of the information for it to be able to scan and analyze each individually.  It simply changes the job from while I don't have to manage the documents, this marks my understanding that I may have to manage its automations by doing a lot of training on how the operations work, providing it a set of reminders that mattered to us (context).

## **Skill Code Analysis**

### **Challenge**

The tool transforms the challenge of the pain point by providing a secure and unlimited storage hub for the company. It completely eliminates the challenge of manual data entry and file searching. However, it introduces a new, more advanced challenge of debugging AI-generated systems, designing effective UI/UX, and creating an automation logic that allows the task to be done. While it gives the opportunity to input the documents, it has no idea of structure and therefore, it keeps the challenge of manual organization and critique to its behaviors. 

### **Complexity**

The tool struggles with its nuance and judgement at this point in the training. It failed to organize the entire syncing of the Google Drive files on its own and restored to just 30 days. As a company, this is not enough. Since it couldn't understand the already established company, it preserved a nuanced approach to minimizing the complexity of 10GB. This then led to it judging a document to be “expired”. This proves that the AI eliminates simple tasks by classification but cannot handle deep business portals. The human operator must preserve and manage this complexity by providing explicit rules and verifying the output in the initial stages or even in the prolonged usage as changes occur and new vendors are incorporated. 

### **Connection**

This tool dove deep into collaboration since it was applicable to a current job. As I worked with the AI agent, I had to direct its changes as sometimes it was biased and only made changes to specific pages. The app could not have been built by either one of us alone since I don't know how to code and it doesn't know the company. It just became another one of my employees. I had to train how we operate as a company which is very time consuming and there were days where we would go back-and-forth for hours. This was all because, just like an employee, it takes time to learn all the aspects of something “new”. Instead of throwing all of the information at the AI at once and giving it all the knowledge possible, there must be a structured operation in the mentorship or delivery so that each item is complete and operates.

## **Bottom Line**

* **Who Should Use This**: Project managers, small business owners, and well-informed users who want to build custom internal tools with a team. It's for people who want to automate a system that can work for multiple users.   
* **Who Should Avoid This**: Companies or Project Managers that rarely see changes or serious growth in their vendors. These people are not interested in adjusting or doing manual verification as they use the app.  
* **Hidden Costs**: The token limit is a hard cost but the real hidden cost is the human time required for debugging, verification, and refinement especially for the company it is applicable to. I was hoping for an application I can just program and use but it costs more investment as we see growth and expansion.  
* **My Verdict**: This would be a game changer and I would definitely think of using it at my first job but probably not for this approach. It provides the ability to automate systemic problems and if I’m willing to dedicate time and conduct manual modifications, it allows for changes. These changes give the AI more knowledge and increase its adaptability as time proceeds which is a huge competitive advantage that our current system does not allow for.
